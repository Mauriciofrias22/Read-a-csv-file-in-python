# Read-a-csv-file-in-python
the read_csv.py program reads a csv file in python and print it on screen
the open_csv.py program prompts for a file name, then opens that file and reads through the file, looking for lines of the form:
X-DSPAM-Confidence:    0.8475
then counts the lines and extract the floating point values from each of the lines and compute the average of those values.
